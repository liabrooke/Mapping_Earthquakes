# Mapping_Earthquakes
###### I don't use the git/push/pull commands through Terminal because they never worked. I always manually upload files to GitHub so completing this module with the many branches that are supposed to use those commands was very challenging. Need to keep working on it to see if I can figure out how to get the commands working.
